# Pricing - lokdentists

**We take pride in your smile**



**Dental treatment can seem expensive but the cost involved is necessary for you to maintain the best of health.**



The pricing of our dental treatments vary depending on the your requirements, however we will work with you honestly and fairly to reach a reasonable price. The best way to keep the cost of dental treatment down is to visit us for regular, low cost checkups. This will help you maintain your dental health and will give us the chance to warn you of potentially more expensive problems. We aim to keep our prices competitive, while providing you with the very best in service and technology. Let us discuss your treatment with you upfront so that you don’t suffer from ‘bill shock’ at the end of your treatment.



**Claiming your dental expenses**



Depending on your health insurance provider, you will be able to recover some of the costs of your dental treatment. Please speak to your provider to determine the amount you will be eligible to claim. To make it easy for you, we let you claim back some of the cost of your treatment on the spot by using our HICAPS system. Ask our receptionist – it’s easy!
