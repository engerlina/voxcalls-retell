# Testimonials - lokdentists

Here are a few comments from some of our satisfied customers:



“Always great service and a gentle experience. Would highly recommend for orthodontics and teeth extractions (I had four wisdom teeth taken out painlessly!)” –**Ms Jessica Yang**



“A big, big thumbs up for Adrian and Kenny at Lok Dentists in Chatswood for seeing me at the drop of a hat today for some emergency work. The guys took in what I thought was wrong, gave me some options and went to work – no fuss, no hassle! It’s always great to know you have access to professionals who genuinely care and go out of their way to make sure you’re in as little discomfort as possible (helped greatly by the state of the art facilities at their new Chatswood branch). Thanks again guys!” – **Mr Stan Choi**



“The dentists there are very professional. Extremely high hygienic standard.” –**Ms Ingrid Wang**



“Super impressed with the filling and clean done by Dr Adrian Lok. We did an xray first to identify the problem and he was very patient and clear in explaining to me how to solve the problem. I’ve seen a few different dentists in the past but this was by far the most comfortable and hassle-free experience. Would definitely recommend.” – **Ms Hong Wang**



“Top Dentist in Sydney. Highly professional, very friendly service. Would recommend to anyone.” –**Mr Linson Lee**



“Nice friendly service and get the job done! Highly recommended!” –**Mrs Han Choi**
